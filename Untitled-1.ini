Unanswered Questions for Technical Deep Dive
GitHub and Tosca Integration Details
Context: Duke Energy uses GitHub for code repositories and Tosca for test automation. They want clarity on how SeaLights integrates with these tools, including API calls and connection handling.
Who Asked:
Randy Emerson
“Our code is stored in GitHub… We've moved away from Jenkins. I see references to plugins for Jenkins but not GitHub. How do you all handle the GitHub repositories? Do you all have support for that as well?”
“I was just trying to ask kind of how that connection was handled and kind of how the Tosca repositories connection was handled… API calls or kind of how that connection's made.”
Arik’s Response:
“Definitely… but I’ll leave it to the engineers to provide better answers than me giving you half aspect answers here.”
Test Listener and Code Spills
Context: Concern about performance issues when code spills to slower storage during execution. They asked if SeaLights detects or monitors such conditions.
Who Asked:
Prannoy Ravela
“Does the test listener also look for code spills?”
“Whenever the code execution reaches that limit… does SeaLights also do that?”
Arik’s Response:
“No, this is something that we're not focused on.”
Test Driven Development & Unit Testing Coverage
Context: Duke Energy wants confirmation that SeaLights captures coverage from unit tests and test-driven development practices, not just end-to-end tests like Tosca.
Who Asked:
Randy Emerson
“Does it pick up all those types of tests? So if you've got a test driven development that's within the code versus Tosca test… does this report include all that?”
Arik’s Response:
“I believe the answer is yes, but let me take this question back and we'll make sure that we cover this in the next.”
Advanced Insight on Untested Code Changes
Context: They asked if SeaLights provides actionable guidance on how to cover untested code changes (e.g., suggesting a single API test to close gaps).
Who Asked:
Athma Ajan
“Does it have any additional insights as to… I can cover all this for untested code changes with a single API test?”
Arik’s Response:
“Everything I'm showing today doesn't use AI, but we do have in beta the ability to propose test cases… we can show it next time.”
Action for SE Team
Prepare technical answers and demos for:
GitHub and Tosca integration (API calls, connection handling).
Clarification on unit test and TDD coverage.
Confirm scope of supported frameworks beyond Tosca (e.g., Selenium, JUnit).
Explain why code spills are out of scope and any related performance monitoring options.
Showcase AI-driven test case generation for closing coverage gaps.

Metrics
Chris Wilson highlighted that high cost is a major concern at Duke Energy. He stated the organization is actively evaluating ways to reduce expenses, which often translates into doing less rather than optimizing for the right amount at the right cost.

“High cost is a major concern at Duke right now. We're actively going through the whole can I do it for cheaper, which always turns into can I do less…
